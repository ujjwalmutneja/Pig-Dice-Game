# Sound Effects Directory

This directory is ready for audio files to enhance the game experience.

## Required Sound Files (optional):

- `roll.mp3` - Played when dice is rolled
- `hold.mp3` - Played when player holds their score
- `switch.mp3` - Played when switching players
- `victory.mp3` - Played when a player wins
- `newgame.mp3` - Played when starting a new game
- `lose.mp3` - Played when rolling a 1

## Audio Format Support:

The game supports common web audio formats:
- MP3 (recommended for broad compatibility)
- WAV (for high quality)
- OGG (for open source preference)

## Implementation:

The game code already includes audio handling with graceful fallbacks. Simply add the sound files to this directory and they will automatically be used.

Example files you could use:
- Short, pleasant sound effects work best
- Keep file sizes under 100KB for fast loading
- Ensure sounds are not jarring or too loud
- Consider accessibility - sounds should enhance, not distract
